<h1 align="left">Heart Disease Dataset- using Classification model</h1>

###

<h2 align="left">Project Description:</h2>

###

<p align="left">The 1988 dataset encompasses four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V, with a total of 76 attributes. Despite its breadth, research typically focuses on a subset of 14 attributes. The pivotal "target" field denotes the presence of heart disease, coded as 0 for absence and 1 for disease, making it a vital dataset for heart disease prediction studies.</p>

<h2 align="left">Steps-Wise in the Project:</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. Importing Libraries: Begin by importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.<br><br>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure, summary statistics, and distributions. This step involves checking for missing values, visualizing data distributions, and identifying potential relationships between variables.<br><br>3. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is ready for preprocessing.<br><br>4. Preprocessing:Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.<br><br>5. Model Building: Build machine learning models using algorithms like RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc. Train the models on the training data.<br><br>6. Predictions: Make predictions on the test set using the trained models.<br><br>7. Model Evaluation:Evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, ROC curve, and AUC score.</p>

<h2 align="left">Conclusion:</h2>

###

<p align="left">Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the highest accuracy or the most suitable evaluation metric for your problem. RandomForestClassifier seems to be performing well with 99% accuracy.</p>
